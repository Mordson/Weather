✨ <bold>Weather Project</bold> ✨

This project was created for a university course to familiarize ourselves with using API's and databases. The database used is SQLite3 and the API used is weatherapi.com.

The project consists of the following files:

1. DB.py: This file is responsible for storing the data in the database.
2. weather.py: This file retrieves data from the API and passes it to DB.py to be stored.
3. GetData.py: This file retrieves data from the database and passes it to chart_Temp.py and chart_Speed.py to be visualized.
4. chart_Temp.py: This file visualizes the temperature data from the database.
5. chart_Speed.py: This file visualizes the wind speed data from the database.

To run the project, first run weather.py multiple times to retrieve and store the data, then run GetData.py to retrieve the data from the database and visualize it.
